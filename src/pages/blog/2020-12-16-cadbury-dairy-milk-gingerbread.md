Godammit Cadbury have actually made a good block 'o' choc. This chocolate BANGS. If chocolates were a festival this would be the headliner, like Kanye West or Daft Punk or something. Everything about this choc is fab. The gingerbread taste is super accurate and nostalgic. There are even some crunchy pieces of gingerbread for entertaining the inner tastebuds. 

X factor is high because Cadbury chocs are usually disappointing, but not this one. I am in a festive mood now ty.
