Aldi normally brings the goods, normally. Not this time. Fruit and nut is usually one of my fave go to flavors, which I thought could do no wrong. However, this choccy was more bland than butter on wet bread. The chocolate itself had no real flavor and the texture was really crumbly. The fruit and nuts didn't really add anything either, no change in texture or consistency. Overall a bit of a letdown. SAD TIMES
