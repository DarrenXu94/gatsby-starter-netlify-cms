## Taste

Amazing, like nothing I've ever had. The flavours were so rich but not overpowering, the hint of savory from the pretzel really brought it home.

## Texture
The pretzel was CHONKY and you could see it on the outside of the block. The block was a good girth, perfect for smashing through.

## Price
Great price for a special occasion but could not afford to smash every week.

## Mouth feel
Unique textures from the pretzel and peanut butter. Very enjoyable to eat.

## X Factor
The packaging was very aesthetic.
