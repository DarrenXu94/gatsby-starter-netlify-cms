Kitkat Hazelnutty caught my eye as I was browsing the choccy section at Woolworths. I had previously had the Kitkat gold and was extremely impressed by it so I thought why not?

The taste, whilst still smashable, was not too dissimilar to the regular Kitkat. As I consumed the dairy treat I noticed an extremely subtle hazelnut flavour kissing gently on the back of the tongue. A pleasant experience, however would have desired a stronger participation from the hazelnut team.

The consistency of the Kitkat wafer textures is one of life's constants. Light but still CRONCHY makes the treat a party in the mouth. The one complaint I did have about this choc was the chocolate taking a liquid form the moment it touched my fingers. Why does the chocolate slip off the wafer like a well lubricated child down a playground slide?

Overall a nice experience. Would buy again
