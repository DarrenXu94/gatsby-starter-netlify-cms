Ginger beer and Whittaker's chocolate, two of my favourite things, but will they go well together?

On my initial approach to consuming the chocolate I saw that it had a gooey caramel inside. This was a bit of a surprise to me and I was worried that the caramel flavours would be too overpowering. However, this was not the case. The initial bites of the chocolate had a strong ginger taste, but subsequent chews re-aligned the palate. The ginger did add a bit of a special X factor to the taste as I never had anything like it, but I'm not sure if it enhanced the experience. Either way, it was a bold move which I enjoyed.

The texture was a smooth traditional Whittaker's block with gooey caramel that was velvet enough to slide down the throat without congestion, a problem many caramel based chocolates have. Mouth feel was very pleasant.
