Hey Tiger again with the goods, this time delivering a tasty Birthday Cake flavor. What's birthday cake flavor you ask? Well I couldn't really tell ya, maybe like a bit vanilla-ey, bit nutty, bit milk choccy. Choccy was probably a bit too sweet for my liking, not smashable but perhaps a blessing in disguise. Texture was fun AF with crunchy pieces of something (maybe sprinkles, maybe cake crumbs) and it was like a party in my mouth. 

Overall very pleased with my experience.
