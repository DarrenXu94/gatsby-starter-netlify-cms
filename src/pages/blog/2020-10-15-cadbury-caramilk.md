## Taste
Honestly I have never been so disappointed in something before. It sucked. What was all the hype about? Such a overpoweringly bland flavour.

## Texture
Just your standard chocolate blockolate. Nothing special. NOTHING.

## Price
I'll only ever buy this if it's more than 50% off. Even so big if.

## Mouth feel
The worst mouth feel of them all. Somehow dry and sticky. Made my throat hurt.

## X Factor
I heard this chocolate was discontinued and brought back due to popular demand. I now deem that to be a MASSIVE LIE and a huge marketing SCAM.
