description: Darrell Lea's Fairy Block will take you back to your simpler
  days, where Fairy Bread at birthday parties was all the rage. A yummy
  combination of 100s and 1000s, soft mini marshmallows and milk chocolate.
  Simple combination of crunch and soft.

I thought it would be a fun little choccy that reminded me of a simpler time. Well, it was simple that's for sure. The 100's and 1000's added nothing really to the taste, and only a little annoying crunch factor.

The chocolate itself was an acceptable Darrel Lea milk choc but nothing too special.

Mouth feel was fine, good block sizes and smashability.
