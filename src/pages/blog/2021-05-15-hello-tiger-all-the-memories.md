A special occasion for Hello Tiger as they are shutting up shop, with All the Memories being relevant to the times. All the Memories provides a vegan dark peanut butter and raspberry taste. The flavor wasn't too strong but the texture was quite fun. A good choc to snack on one piece at a time, defs would not smash a whole block at once. The peanut butter taste was subtle and the berry giving an occasional texture change. Overall not their best but still enjoyed.
