![Just Organic Dark Choc](/img/justorganic.jpg)

Decided to pick this choc up from ALDI. Wasn't expecting too much. Initial bites were quite bitter but then I remembered it was a dark choc so it was actually surprisingly sweet. (Hit me with a reverse card)



Texture quite bland, nothing too special, even girth of the block. The sea salt was barely a flavour at all. This doesn't get the lowest mouth feel because the block sizes were actually quite pleasant in size and didn't make my throat go all funny.
