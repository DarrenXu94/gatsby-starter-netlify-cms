## Taste
Nice choccy flavours but nothing out of the ordinary. Marshmallows were a bit bland but the peanuts added some more spice. 

## Texture
The block itself looks extremely unappealing, like muddy acne, from the marshmallows. Ripping the blocks apart feels gross because you are peeling apart blocks of marshmallows, not snapping bars of chocolate like a normal block. Marshmallows made it hard to chew, like having a jaw workout. Not for me.

## Price
On special at Woolies, can't complain, could buy often.

## Mouth feel
Many different textures made it a bit exciting, however in a bad way. Too much going on. Can't smash through it easily.

## X Factor
The choccy was a bit different so I'll give them some credit for trying.
