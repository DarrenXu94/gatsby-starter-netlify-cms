### Taste
The most important and obvious factor to rating choccy is the taste. I enjoy a smooth yet subtle flavor. Not too overwhelming but pleasant to eat plenty of.

### Texture
For me, the texture cannot be bland but rather an exciting adventure to pertake in. The blocks of chocolate should not be too thick as to be a chore to eat, rather a more mangable and crunchable size.

### Price
I ain't made of money, but I am willing to splash for good quality.

### Mouth feel
The mouth feel is a very underrated rating category. Chocolate these days have a variety of fillings inside the chocolate, some have popping candy and others have milk bottles. These can be both positive and detrimental towards the overall rating. I also hate it when you eat too much of a chocolate and you get a weird ass feeling in the back of your throat.

### X factor
Nice packaging? Vegan? Funny shapes? All bonuses for me.
